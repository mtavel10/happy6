CONGRATS U DIDNT GET EXPLODED! Haha you 
THOUGHT I was doing python practice problems the other day HAHA jokes on you 
I was making you a gift HA. Why tf would I be doing pygame in my free time that 
stuff is for nerds. Also sorry this was formatted so horribly I finished this a 
couple of hours ago. Also pls don't look at the code it's jank asf. 










Paulina, my love, no matter how many times I press ink into cardstock or etch 
graphite across a page, it never feels enough to express how much love I have 
for you. The words in this message will probably fall short of how I feel. It's 
getting harder to write these letters to you. Not because I'm running out of 
corny things to say, but because my feelings for you have grown and deepened far
beyond my writing abilities. So I've decided to use a higher art form: Pygame

In the past six months I feel like I got to know you better than I've known
anyone. I love how you adore your family, your brother, your friends, and Nickel. 
I love how you get all excited to share tea, or talk about what food you ate, or 
the traffic you battled on the way to/from Carlsbad. I love you warm you are, 
how safe you make me feel, your intelligence, drive, and passions. You light up
my life, day and night, and every second I feel so incredibly lucky to love you. 
In the past six months, seconds have warped, stretched, and compressed, and I 
can't tell if they're flying by or I've just known you forever. 

Again, these finite words barely encompass the infinite love I feel for you. 
The objective (representative) reality is exceeded by the formal (actual) reality. 
Idk, as some stupid philosopher would say. I can't press it into these pixels. 
So, every world I jot down, every address I copy or envelope sealed, every 
byte of text I type: each holds a piece of my love. I'll go on forever to send it all. 

See you soon my love, 

-Mads
